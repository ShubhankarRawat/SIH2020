# Appliances Energy Prediction
There are enormous number of appliances associated with a building irrespective of nature (industrial, commercial, residential, etc).
These appliances could vary from fans, chargers, etc. to any other electronic instrument big or small. Hence, they account for a large portion of the total energy consumed within a building. Estimating the energy consumed by such appliances provides an edge in monitoring the energy consumption of the building and hence helps the operator in optimizaing the energy consumption of the building. 

Due to the presence of large number of appliances within a building, the amount of data generated becomes huge and it becomes impossible for the operator to manage. In order to resolve this issue Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially Machine Learning, is proposed in this project for fast, efficient, and highly accurate results.

## Case study
The building considered in this case study has numerous zones and hence parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc are considered for appliance energy consumption prediction.

# ML Models
Predicting the energy consumption of appliances becomes a regression problem. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) with Bayesian Optimization was implemented for predicting the energy consumption of the appliances.
